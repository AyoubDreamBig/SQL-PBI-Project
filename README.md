## Case Study: Enhancing Sales Reporting with SQL and Power BI :

Introduction
This case study examines a project aimed at transforming sales reporting from static reports to dynamic, visual dashboards. The initiative was driven by the sales team, specifically Steven, the Sales Manager, who recognized the need for a more interactive and insightful way to monitor internet sales performance.

Background
The sales department relied on static reports to track sales, which limited their ability to quickly analyze data and make informed decisions. Steven identified several key areas for improvement:

Tracking Sales Over Time: Understanding trends and patterns in sales data.
Product Performance: Identifying top-selling products.
Customer Analysis: Determining which customers are generating the most revenue.
Budget Comparison: Evaluating sales performance against budget targets.
Project Objectives
The primary goal was to implement a Power BI solution to create visual dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of internet sales. The dashboards needed to:

Allow sales managers and representatives to filter data by products and customers.
Compare sales data against budget for performance evaluation.
Update automatically on a daily basis to ensure timely insights.
Implementation
Data Preparation with SQL
The first step involved preparing the data using SQL. This included:

Data Extraction: Pulling sales data from the CRM system and budget data from Excel spreadsheets.
Data Transformation: Cleaning and structuring the data to be compatible with Power BI requirements. This included aggregating sales figures, linking sales to specific products and customers, and calculating budget comparisons.
Data Loading: Storing the prepared data in a SQL database for efficient querying and retrieval by Power BI.
Dashboard Development with Power BI
With the data prepared, the next phase was developing the Power BI dashboards:

Sales Overview Dashboard: Provided a high-level view of total sales, top-performing products, and key customers. It included filters to allow users to drill down into specific data points.
Product Performance Dashboard: Focused on product-specific sales data, showing trends and identifying best-selling items. Users could filter by product categories.
Customer Analysis Dashboard: Highlighted customer-specific sales data, enabling sales representatives to identify key customers and tailor their sales strategies.
Budget Comparison Dashboard: Compared actual sales figures against budgeted targets, using visual KPIs and graphs to highlight variances.
User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
The project was guided by specific user stories, ensuring that the final solution met the needs of different users:
